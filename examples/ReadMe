The following instructions explain how to port the existing Gobblin Plugin Code to the docker-gaas

We are considering the wikiperia example. 

1) Start the gaas environment, this is done by executing this

$GAAS_DOCKER_HOME ./runall.sh <pid>

2) Next is to deploy the wikipedia to the GAAS
$GAAS_DOCKER_HOME 
cd examples/wikipedia
$GAAS_DOCKER_HOME/examples/wikipedia  gradle restartDockerContainers -Pgid=<groupId>

3) Finally test it
$GAAS_DOCKER_HOME/examples/wikipedia ./test.sh <gid>

If you want to port the application with the artifacts as foo.jar and foo.template as the the template file.
The foo.template can be fleshed out from the foo.pull file. Follow the steps to test it on the docker-gaas

1) create a directory as foomigration.

2) create a lib directory in the foomigration and copy foo.jar into it. If there are other dependent jars those all
should go into it.

3) Copy foo.template into the foomigration.

4) Create a build.gradle into the foomigration directory, you can refer to the build.gradle in the examples directory.
You may have to make sure that build.gradle copies foo.jar( also dependent jars) and foo.template to the gaas-docker containers.

5) Finally create a test.sh to test the deployment, you can refer to the existing test.sh in the examples directory for reference.
