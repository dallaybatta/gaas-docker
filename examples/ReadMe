You can pass the group id as gid and restart the docker gaas for a specific group

gradle restartDockerContainers -Pgid=<groupId>


The copyRuntimeLibsToGAAS task in the build.gradle should build the gobblin plugins in a project and then copy the templates and jars to the 
gaas folder. In case of the wikipedia example we are not building the libraries, we are using the same. Considering the case where there are 
plugin's are available they could be easily deployed in the gobblin gaas cluster by using the gradle builds as reference.
